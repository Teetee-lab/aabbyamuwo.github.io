                <p>I am Titilayo Amuwo, however, I like to be called Abigael. I specialize in the fields of Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Cloud computing. I received my Associate degree from Rufus Giwa Polytechnic in 2008 and Bachelors from the University of Lagos in 2015, where I studied Business Administration and Management. After my associate degree, I landed my first job as a Security Trading Operation Specialist at Stanbic IBTC Bank. After working as a Banker for 6 years, I continued to work in the field of Accounting and Finance for 5 years which means that I not only have experience as an Operation specialist but also in Accounting where I get to analyze data and share reports with stakeholders. <br>Since my teenage years, I have always had a passion for technology and innovation; aside from that, I am the go-to person in my family and among friends when it comes to information technology. This has always been my passion; however, things change along the line and I follow the family tradition of going into business and management so, I pursued another degree instead. While working as an accountant, I realized that we use data every day and the same data is used to build a dashboard where we can share valuable information with our clients about their finances. I wanted to learn more about the designs and software, and use it to develop my skill set; hence, I decided to merge my previous experience using data and my passion for innovation by pursuing another career in Information Technology, data science to be precise. <br>Since transitioning into a data science career in 2021, I have been contracted to work at companies and also had the opportunity to Intern at one of the leading cybersecurity companies in Palo Alto. With that being said, I am a versatile Data science professional with experience in compiling, transforming, and analyzing complex information using data science skills. As a Data scientist, I have helped develop advanced visualization concepts and implemented machine learning algorithms that allow businesses to make better decisions that yield high returns on investment. My background allows me to provide insights that drive business decisions and I am confident in my ability to use my technical and interpersonal skills to make an impact in any organization. <br>Outside of work, I enjoy playing with my daughter, drawing, reading and volunteering at Women Who Code Global as a community member or collaborating at other non profit organizations. Currently, I am learning how to build and develop a Large Language model to assist organizations evolve in the financial market while they make a better decision that will increase return on Investment. I am certain that I can facilitate positive change, and impact outcomes in any organization.</p>
